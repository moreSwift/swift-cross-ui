# WinUI Test Plan: P0-P4

This document describes the manual UI test steps for the apps in `testapp`. The goal is to quickly reproduce and verify WinUIBackend-related issues.

## Preparation

1. Go to the project root:

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\lowei\proj\swift-cross-ui
   ```

2. Compile the test apps:

   ```powershell
   sh testapp/compile.sh
   ```

3. Go to the output directory:

   ```powershell
   cd testapp\output
   ```

4. Confirm that the runtime resource exists:

   ```powershell
   Test-Path .\swift-winui_CWinAppSDK.resources\Microsoft.WindowsAppRuntime.Bootstrap.dll
   ```

   Expected result: `True`.

## Common Checks

- The app can open its main window.
- The console does not show a fatal error or stack trace.
- The window remains interactive; buttons, inputs, and menus respond.
- The process exits normally after closing the app.
- If a crash occurs, record:
  - Which exe was running
  - Which control was clicked
  - The last log line before the crash
  - Swift / WinUIBackend file names and line numbers from the stack trace

## P0: Critical Lifecycle

Run:

```powershell
.\P0.exe
```

Covered issues:

- #493 (Fixed): WinUIBackend may crash when an environment action is called too early
- #548 (Fixed): `@AppStorage` crashes on Windows
- No dedicated issue (Fixed): WinUIBackend `setSizeLimits` unimplemented log
- No dedicated issue (Fixed): WinUIBackend `setIncomingURLHandler` unimplemented log

Test steps:

1. Launch `P0.exe`.
2. Confirm that the main window `P0 WinUI critical checks` appears.
3. Confirm that the console does not show these unimplemented logs:
   - `setSizeLimits(ofWindow:minimum:maximum:) unimplemented`
   - `setIncomingURLHandler(to:) not implemented`
4. Click `Increment @AppStorage` several times to verify #548 (Fixed).
5. Click `Reset` to verify #548 (Fixed).
6. Close the app, launch it again, and confirm that the launch count still updates normally to verify #548 (Fixed).
7. Click `Show AlertScene`; confirm that the alert appears and can be closed with OK to verify #493 (Fixed).
8. Click `Present environment alert after 1 second`; confirm that the alert appears after 1 second to verify #493 (Fixed).
9. Click `Present environment alert now`; confirm that the alert appears to verify #493 (Fixed).

Expected results:

- The app should not crash at launch.
- The `@AppStorage` buttons should not crash; if they do, #548 (Fixed) regressed.
- AlertScene and environment alerts should display normally.
- If an alert crashes and the error contains `XamlRoot`, #493 (Fixed) regressed.

## P1: Dialogs And Sheets

Run:

```powershell
.\P1.exe
```

Covered issues:

- #523 (Fixed): Windows file open/save dialogs are slow to appear
- #659 (Fixed): Nested sheets are not supported
- #660 (Fixed): Sheets have default padding

Test steps:

1. Launch `P1.exe`.
2. Click `Open file dialog`.
3. Select any file or cancel; record how long the dialog takes to appear and return to verify #523 (Fixed).
4. Click `Open folder dialog`.
5. Select any folder or cancel; record how long the dialog takes to appear and return to verify #523 (Fixed).
6. Click `Save file dialog`.
7. Select a save destination or cancel; record how long the dialog takes to appear and return to verify #523 (Fixed).
8. Click `Open root sheet`.
9. Observe the padding around the root sheet content to verify #660 (Fixed).
10. Click `Open nested sheet`.
11. Confirm whether the nested sheet appears and closes correctly to verify #659 (Fixed).

Expected results:

- File, folder, and save dialogs should open without crashing.
- Dialogs should not visibly take more than 2 seconds to appear; if one does, record it as a #523 (Fixed) regression.
- If the nested sheet cannot appear or crashes, record it as a #659 (Fixed) regression.
- If the red bar in the root sheet is still clearly surrounded by padding, record it as a #660 (Fixed) regression.

## P2: Controls And Styling

Run:

```powershell
.\P2.exe
```

Covered issues:

- #449 (Fixed): Picker options do not update correctly
- #471 (Fixed): TextEditor has a thin border when unfocused
- #401 (Fixed): Full screen button is not disabled when window resizing is disabled
- #390 (Fixed): Disabled buttons do not look visibly disabled

Test steps:

1. Launch `P2.exe`.
2. Open the Picker and confirm that the initial options are only `Vanilla` and `Chocolate` to verify #449 (Fixed).
3. Check `Use expanded Picker options` to verify #449 (Fixed).
4. Open the Picker again and confirm that `Strawberry`, `Mint`, and `Coffee` were added and selectable to verify #449 (Fixed).
5. Click the TextEditor and type `12345`; confirm that no keystrokes are dropped to verify #471 (Fixed).
6. Click another control so the TextEditor loses focus; confirm that there is no unfocused thin border to verify #471 (Fixed).
7. Compare the disabled button and enabled button; confirm whether the visual difference is clear to verify #390 (Fixed).
8. Toggle `Enable button row` and confirm that the disabled state updates visually to verify #390 (Fixed).
9. Toggle `Allow window resizing` to verify #401 (Fixed).
10. Observe the window resize / full screen button behavior to verify #401 (Fixed).

Expected results:

- Picker options should update when state changes, and the dropdown should not immediately disappear; if it fails, record it as a #449 (Fixed) regression.
- Clicking the Picker should not print WinUI/Composition rendering diagnostic logs such as `BVI-*`, `rcBackdropLocal`, or `CachedNewBlur`; if it does, record it as a #204 (Fixed) regression.
- TextEditor input should not drop keystrokes, and the unfocused TextEditor should match the expected borderless appearance; if it fails, record it as a #471 (Fixed) regression.
- Disabled controls should clearly look disabled; if not, record it as a #390 (Fixed) regression.
- When window resizing is disabled, the user should not be able to resize or full screen the window normally; if it is still possible, record it as a #401 (Fixed) regression.

## P3: Layout And Clipping

Run:

```powershell
.\P3.exe
```

Covered issues:

- #389 (Fixed): Images are not clipped
- P3 three-column test board initial layout regression (Fixed)

Test steps:

1. Launch `P3.exe`.
2. Before resizing the window, confirm that the sidebar, middle, and detail columns are fully visible.
3. Confirm that the image detail column does not cover the sidebar or middle column.
4. Click `Force state update` and confirm that the three columns do not jump or suddenly correct themselves.
5. Resize the window and confirm that the three columns remain reasonable.
6. Click `Small`, `Medium`, and `Large` in the image size controls.
7. Observe the test image on the black background to verify #389 (Fixed).
8. Confirm whether the Large image is clipped by the 220x140 frame to verify #389 (Fixed).
9. Switch back to Small / Medium and confirm that the image updates normally and remains inside the frame to verify #389 (Fixed).

Expected results:

- The initial three-column layout should be correct without waiting for a state update or resize.
- The oversized image should not spill outside the black frame.
- If the image overflows the frame, record it as a #389 (Fixed) regression.
- If the initial layout is wrong but fixes itself after resize, record it as a P3 three-column layout (Fixed) regression.

## P4: WinUI Native And Callback Stress

Run:

```powershell
.\P4.exe
```

Covered issues:

- #190 (Fixed): Callbacks are stored in backend-wide hashmaps
- #156 (Fixed): WinUI-specific escape hatch / native API access
- #204 (Fixed): Update to latest stable WinUI / WinUI console noise
- #470 (Fixed): Regenerate WinUI bindings with latest swift-winrt

Test steps:

1. Launch `P4.exe`.
2. Confirm that the native WinUI banner is displayed to verify #156 (Fixed).
3. Type text into `Native inspection text` to verify #156 (Fixed).
4. Confirm that the native banner content updates to verify #156 (Fixed).
5. Click `Force update` several times to verify #190 (Fixed).
6. Click several `Run N` callback buttons to verify #190 (Fixed).
7. Confirm that the `callbacks` count increases and `Selected row` updates to verify #190 (Fixed).
8. Click `More rows` several times to verify #190 (Fixed).
9. Scroll the row list to the bottom; confirm that the row window slides forward (the displayed range advances) while the scroll position stays visually continuous.
10. Click `Rows 250`, then `Run last`; confirm that the final row window is shown and the UI does not stall for a long time.
11. Click `Run 249`; confirm that `callbacks` and `Selected row` quickly update to 249 to verify #190 (Fixed).
12. Click `Fewer rows` several times to verify #190 (Fixed).
13. Click an existing row button again to verify #190 (Fixed).
14. Open the Picker or trigger a WinUI backdrop update; confirm that the console no longer prints `BVI-*`, `rcBackdropLocal`, or bare matrix/size noise to verify #204 (Fixed).

Expected results:

- Callbacks should not become incorrect, disappear, or crash.
- Scrolling near the bottom/top of the row list should slide the row window forward/backward while keeping at most 50 rows rendered (Windows only; use `Load next rows` on other platforms).
- After changing the row count, both old and new buttons should trigger the correct row.
- WinUI native inspection should be able to change the style of the underlying control.
- `Force update` and editing `Native inspection text` should update the native banner.
- When the row count is large, visible row callbacks should still update quickly.
- If callbacks point to the wrong row after many updates, record it as a #190 (Fixed) regression.
- If WinUI backdrop diagnostic noise appears in the console again, record it as a #204 (Fixed) regression.
